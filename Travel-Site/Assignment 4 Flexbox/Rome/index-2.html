            <p><strong>The Yellow:  </strong>This sharp, 300-bed party hostel, with designer dorms, play area sporting comfy beanbags, escape room and kitchen you'd actually want to hang out in, is rapidly colonising the entire street – aka the 'Yellow Square' – with its top-notch facilities aimed squarely at young travellers.

What with the bike tours, cooking classes, rooftop yoga, burlesque classes and stacks of other social events it hosts – not to mention DJs every night in its stylish bar across the street – guests have little time to actually sleep.

            <h2>Restaurants</h2>

            <p><strong>Colline Emiliane:  </strong>Sensational regional cuisine from Emilia-Romagna aside, what makes this small white-tablecloth dining address so outstanding is its family vibe and overwhelmingly warm service. Stronghold of the Latini family since the 1930s, son Luca today runs the show together with his mother Paola (dessert queen), aunt Anna (watch her making fresh pasta each morning in the glassed-off lab) and father Massimo.The kitchen flies the flag for Emilia-Romagna, the well-fed Italian province that has blessed the world with Parmesan, balsamic vinegar, bolognese sauce and Parma ham. Winter ushers white truffles with eggs, pasta or gooey Fontina cheese onto the menu. Whatever you do, don't scrimp on dolci – Anna's warm caramelised hazelnut and walnut tart is out of this world.</p>

            <p><strong>Pianostrada:  </strong>Hatched in foodie Trastevere but now across the river in a mellow white space with vintage furnishings and glorious summer courtyard, this bistro is a fashionable must. Reserve ahead, or settle for a stool at the bar and enjoy big bold views of the kitchen at work. Cuisine is refreshingly creative, seasonal, veg-packed including gourmet open sandwiches and sensational homemade focaccia as well as full-blown mains.The warm smiles and chit-chat of the charismatic, all-female team – best friends Chiara and Paola, and Paola’s daughters Flaminia and Alice – cap off the relaxed, uber-hip dining experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Eataly:  </strong>Be prepared for some serious taste bud titillation in this state-of-the-art food emporium of gargantuan proportions. Four shop floors showcase every conceivable Italian food product (dried and fresh), while multiple themed food stalls and restaurants offer plenty of opportunity to taste or feast on Italian cuisine.Savour paper-thin slices of raw ostrich, horse, fish or shellfish in the 2nd-floor Ristorantino del Crudo specialising in raw cuisine; lunch on Sicilian and Roman classics in Fattoria delle Torri on the same floor; taste five Italian craft beers on tap in the 1st-floor Birreria (Beer Hall) or different coffee beans in the cafe. There are also cooking classes, demonstrations and wine tastings too.</p>
