            <p>Rome’s great gladiatorial arena is the most thrilling of the city's ancient sights. Inaugurated in AD 80, the 50,000-seat Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was clad in travertine and covered by a huge canvas awning held aloft by 240 masts. Inside, tiered seating encircled the arena, itself built over an underground complex (the hypogeum) where animals were caged and stage sets prepared. Games involved gladiators fighting wild animals or each other.</p>

            <h2>Great Food</h2>
            <p><strong>Colline Emiliane: </strong></p>
            <p>Sensational regional cuisine from Emilia-Romagna aside, what makes this small white-tablecloth dining address so outstanding is its family vibe and overwhelmingly warm service. Stronghold of the Latini family since the 1930s, son Luca today runs the show together with his mother Paola (dessert queen), aunt Anna (watch her making fresh pasta each morning in the glassed-off lab) and father Massimo.</p>
            <p>The kitchen flies the flag for Emilia-Romagna, the well-fed Italian province that has blessed the world with Parmesan, balsamic vinegar, bolognese sauce and Parma ham. Winter ushers white truffles with eggs, pasta or gooey Fontina cheese onto the menu. Whatever you do, don't scrimp on dolci – Anna's warm caramelised hazelnut and walnut tart is out of this world.</p>
            <p>Everything in this city is worth waiting in line for.</p>

            <h2>Hotels</h2>
            <p><strong>The Yellow: </strong>This sharp, 300-bed party hostel, with designer dorms, play area sporting comfy beanbags, escape room and kitchen you'd actually want to hang out in, is rapidly colonising the entire street – aka the 'Yellow Square' – with its top-notch facilities aimed squarely at young travellers....</p>
            <p><strong>Le Stanze Di Orazio: </strong>This friendly boutique B&B makes for an attractive home away from home in the heart of the elegant Prati district, a single metro stop from the Vatican. It has five bright, playfully decorated rooms – think shimmering rainbow wallpaper, lilac accents and designer bathrooms – and a small breakfast area....</p>
            <p><strong>Villa Laetitia: </strong>Villa Laetitia is a stunning boutique hotel in a riverside art-nouveau villa. Its 20 rooms and mini-apartments, spread over the main building and a separate Garden House, were all individually designed by Anna Venturini Fendi of the famous fashion house. The result are interiors which marry modern design touches with family furniture, vintage pieces and rare finds, such as a framed Picasso scarf in the Garden Room....</p>
